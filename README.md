# Online Voting System
The Online Voting System is a secure, web-based application developed using Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and MySQL for persistent data storage. It streamlines the voting process by allowing registered users to vote online. To enhance security, the system implements OTP-based authentication via Gmail, ensuring that only verified users can participate in elections.

# Features

Users receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via Gmail for secure login verification.

Secure Registration and Login
Unique voter credentials with session-based login to ensure identity validation.

Vote Casting
Each user is allowed to vote once per election, with backend checks for duplication.

Admin Panel
Administrators can create elections, manage candidates, and view real-time results.

Automatic Result Calculation
System calculates and displays results after the election ends.

Clean User Interface
HTML and CSS-based responsive design for an intuitive voting experience.
